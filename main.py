# The purpose of this script is to calculate the intrinsic impedence using the amplitude of the incident wave, the permittivity, and the permeability of mediums 1 and 2.

# input the inputs
E = float(input('Amplitude of the Incident Wave (V/m): '))
e1 = float(input('Permittivity of Medium 1: '))
e2 = float(input('Permittivity of Medium 2: '))
mu1 = float(input('Permiability of Medium 1: '))
mu2 = float(input('Permiability of Medium 2: '))

# This calculates the intrinsic impedence of mediums 1(n1) and 2(n2)
n1 = 
n2 = 
# Do the Math
# This calculates the amplitude of the reflected wave(E1) and the transmitted wave(E2)
E1 = (2*n)
E2 =
